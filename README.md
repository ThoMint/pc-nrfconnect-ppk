# nRF Connect Power Profiler

Power Profiler app for
[nRF Connect](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-launcher).

## Modifications
This fork is a modified version of the original Power-Profiling-App for the PPK2.
It contains changes to work with a modified hardware version of the PPK2.
The changes include a wider measurement range and diffrent calibration model.
Further documentation on the mod can be found within the parent repository: [PPK2-Mod](https://github.com/ThoMint/PPK2-Mod).

## Introduction

_nRF Connect Power Profiler_ is a tool to communicate with the
[Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit-2),
an affordable and flexible tool to obtain real-time current measurements of your
designs. It also supports the
[older, first version of the Power Profiler Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit).
The PPK measures current consumption for a connected Nordic Development Kit or
any external board. It gives a detailed picture of the current profile for the
user application.

All functionality is described in the
[User Guide](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_ppk2/UG/ppk/PPK_user_guide_Intro.html)
(If you use the first version of the hardware, there is a different
[User Guide for the PPK 1](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_ppk/UG/ppk/PPK_user_guide_Intro.html)).
